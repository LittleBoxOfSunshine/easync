	<h1>Devolpment Process</h1>
		<div>
		Our team set out to create the perfect group scheduling application:
		one that could take the schedules of multiple members and produce 
		ideal meeting times for everyone.
		</div>

	<h2>Features</h2>
		<div>
		Most of what we set out to accomplish made its way into our application. 
		</div>

		<div>What was cut:</div>
		<ul class="img-list">
			<li>Traditional Group functionality</li>
			<li>Google Hangouts integration</li>
			<li>Note-taking features</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>

		<div>What made it:</div>
		<ul class="img-list">
			<li>Google Calendar integration</li>
			<li>Google login</li>
			<li>Ideal meeting algorithm</li>
			<li></li>

	<h2>Hurdles</h2>
	<div>
		Our team worked surprisingly well together, but that's not to say there weren't challenges to overcome. Most problems arose from communication and an inability to 
		express our personal desires for the project. Several times we had to get together 
		and reiterate the team's goals.
		<br><br>
		There definitely were some technical hurdles as well. Here's some things that gave
		us the most headache:
		<ul class="img-list">
			<li>Google OAuth 2</li>
			<li>Android Studio</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Wishlist</h2>
	<div>We got most of what we wanted, but here's some things we'd like to see in v2.0:</div>
	<ul class="img-list">
		<li>Google Nearyby API</li>
		<li>A visual calendar</li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
	</ul>
